I want to build a grammoji, what should it look like?
You can create anything you want (objects, animals etc).
But be careful do not create emojis ex. :-) Plus we will review your grammoji
to see if there are any similar projects or problems.

Any extra advice?
It would be nice if you create characters that are suitable for all social media networks.
ex. Consider the word restriction when someone will use a grammoji on Twitter.(Use tabs over spaces)
